Due to changes in the build process the individual components making up the Javascript SDK
will no longer be available in source form. 

This repository will when possible be updated with a single non-minified and beautified script, 
representing http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js, but will for now remain inactive.

Please submit any issues using the Bug reporting tool at https://developers.facebook.com/bugs.

To see the repository in its previously published state, please see the [deprecated](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-js-sdk/tree/deprecated) branch.
